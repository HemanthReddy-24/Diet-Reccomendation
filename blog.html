                            eating plan that provides the
                            essential nutrients, vitamins, and minerals needed for optimal health and well-being. It
                            typically includes a variety of foods from different food groups such as fruits, vegetables,
                            whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats, while limiting processed foods, sugars, and
                            unhealthy fats. The goal of a nutritional diet is to support overall health, maintain a
                            healthy weight, and reduce the risk of chronic diseases.</p>

                                        <p class="lead">Nutrition is the study of how food and drink affect our bodies,
                                            encompassing the intake of nutrients, digestion, absorption, metabolism, and
                                            the roles these nutrients play in supporting health and preventing disease.
                                            It involves understanding the various components of food, including
                                            macronutrients (carbohydrates, proteins, fats) and micronutrients (vitamins,
                                            minerals), as well as the impact of dietary patterns on overall well-being.
                                            Nutrition is essential for promoting optimal health, supporting growth and
                                            development, maintaining energy levels, and reducing the risk of chronic
                                            diseases. It emphasizes the importance of making informed food choices to
                                            ensure that individuals meet their nutritional needs and achieve optimal
                                            health outcomes.</p>

                                            Eating inappropriate foods in your diet leads to malnutrition, which poses a
                                            serious risk to human health. Malnutrition, including being overweight and
                                            undernourished, is widespread in the modern world.</p>

                            hydration. A balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and healthy fats
                            ensures adequate intake of these nutrients. Each category plays a vital role in maintaining

                                        <p class="lead">Carbohydrates are considered to as energy providing foods. They
                                            give the body the energy it requires to function.
                                            Simple carbohydrates and complex carbohydrates are two different types of
                                            carbohydrates. Carbohydrates are the main reason for the production of
                                            ketones. Good examples of carbohydrates are bread, potatoes, pasta, soda,
                                            chips, cookies/biscuits, puddings, cakes, sugar, bananas, etc.</p>

                                            Carbohydrates are made up of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms, arranged in

                                            and fiber. Simple carbohydrates, such as glucose and fructose, are found in
                                            foods like fruits, honey, and refined sugars. They are quickly digested and
                                            can cause rapid spikes in blood sugar levels.Consuming excessive amounts of
                                            refined carbohydrates, especially in the form of sugary snacks and
                                            beverages, can contribute to weight gain, insulin resistance, and other
